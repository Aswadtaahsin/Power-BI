# Power-BI
I have used power bi to showcase many different cookies and the data related to them such as cookie type, sales, customers, orders and many more.
I have created a visualization to make it easy for the reader to identify what they are looking at such as what cookie is being sold the most and 
generating the most income or which company is placing the most orders for our cookies. 

I have used many different data sets such as orders, customers and cookie types, cleaned the data and then formatted in a easy to read way. 

I also created a geo location using a different data set on page two just because i was interested in using the map funtion of Power BI
